    longDescription:
      "So while the testosterone hormone itself remains exactly the same, you have these two esters working together with different release timing and duration of effects. This means you get the benefits of both fast acting and long lasting esters combined.",

    benefits:
      "The effects and benefits of Sustanon are going to be identical to those which you get from all other testosterone steroids : size and strength and recovery.",
    usage: `A simple beginner Sustanon 250 cycle can consist of 300-400mg per week for 8 weeks. \n Intermediate users might consider stack Sustanon with one other steroid for more pronounced effects. \n Even in that case, the dosage of Sustanon will still be useful between 500-750mg weekly with a cycle length of 8 to 10 weeks.`,

      "Without a doubt Deca-Durabolin is one of the most effective and respected steroids ever made. The fact that it’s been used for more than 50 years and by some of the world’s best bodybuilders tells us just how beneficial this steroid is.",

    benefits:
      "Deca-Durabolin is effective at promoting lean muscle growth. One of its medical uses is to promote growth in people with muscle wasting conditions, and it has proven benefits at doing just that. Deca promotes a positive nitrogen balance in the muscles, preventing muscle loss. This makes Deca an effective agent to use while cutting for the purpose of muscle preservation.",

    usage:
      "When planning a Deca-Durabolin cycle it must be understood that this is slow acting steroid which requires a longer cycle in order to allow its effects to be fully experienced. 12 weeks is considered the minimum, but 16 to 20 weeks is the optimal cycle length for most people. \n-Beginners: 300-500mg per week.\n-Intermediate: 500-600mg per week.",

      "Although EQ (or Boldenone) does not give us the sheer power in mass gains that testosterone can provide, it comes with a host of benefits both in terms of performance and a noticeable decrease in side effects compared with testosterone itself.",

    benefits:
      "We can almost think of EQ as being a milder version of testosterone. It is based on testosterone after all, but has reduced anabolic effects. This still makes it a very useful steroid to include in a stack, and a steroid that is more versatile than standard testosterone because it’s not just all about massive muscle and strength gains.",

    usage:
      "Equipoise is a steroid that does not benefit from taking very doses, so users of any experience level will want to maintain a similar dose keeping mind that the higher the dose the more likely estrogenic effects are going to be. Moderate doses of EQ provide very manageable estrogen related activity with effective male doses considered to be within the 200mg to 600mg range.",

      "Testosterone Propionate gives us another option when looking to take advantage of the numerous benefits of testosterone in a bodybuilding cycle. If testosterone is your preferred steroid choice and you want to start seeing results very early in a cycle, Testosterone Propionate is the ester you might turn to.",

    benefits:
      "We compare this to the very popular Testosterone Enanthate which can take up to two weeks before you start noticing any effects, there’s going to be a noticeable difference in the progress you can start making in those early weeks of the cycle. Increasing protein synthesis and nitrogen retention. Boosting the count of red blood cells in circulation. Higher output of IGF-1 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor-1). Reduction of stress hormones like cortisol.",

    usage:
      "But as a first time Testosterone Propionate cycle, you will almost certainly find it tolerable to take doses ranging from 300-500mg per week. Side effects should be manageable at these doses. With Testosterone Propionate being a fast acting steroid, cycles can be shorter if you desire because gains will start being seen early on. A cycle length of 8-10 weeks provides a good introduction to Testosterone Propionate for beginners. Intermediate users can pass more than 500mg in a week to 600-700mg .",

      "Guys will often argue about which is “the most powerful steroid” in existence. The word powerful gets thrown around a lot in the steroid world, but very would be game to argue against Trenbolone being at the very top of the most powerful steroid rankings. You will also hear a lot about this or that steroid not being recommended for beginners.",

    benefits:
      "The two most important and obvious benefits of Trenbolone are massive gains in strength and muscle thanks to its significant anabolic nature. Trenbolone is not only used in bulking cycles though. It is excellent for fat loss and cutting as well.",

    usage:
      "Beginners can do 200mg Trenbolone Acetate per week splited into many shots. Intermediate users can go for 300-400mg per week.",

      "Nandrolone Phenylpropionate, known as NPP for short, is a form of Nandrolone with the phenylpropionate ester attached. Another well known form of this steroid compound is Nandrolone Decanoate, also known as Deca-Durabolin.",

    benefits:
      "Nandrolone is well known for its many positive benefits and effects when used for performance enhancement purposes. You’ll also find that this compound comes with some excellent therapeutic effects as well, making NPP a quality all round steroid that will suit a range of users and goals : Mass building and muscle recovery and strength.",

    usage:
      "For guys using NPP for bodybuilding a dosage of up to 400mg weekly is ideal. This strikes the right balance between reaping the benefits while keeping the side effect risk to a minimum. Those who are less concerned about side effects might consider increasing the dosage a little beyond 400mg but for most male users this will be the sweet spot that will deliver excellent results.",

      "Drostanolone Enanthate, or Masteron as it’s commonly known, is a popular cutting compound particularly favored by those who compete in bodybuilding contests because its maximum potential is seen in people who are already lean, cut and are carrying low fat levels.",

    benefits:
      "Masteron is put to best use in a cutting cycle. It is often considered to be a weaker steroid because of its lack of mass building capabilities, but not all steroids are meant for bulking and this is one that has a very niche and specific purpose which will suit anyone who wants the most extreme possible results from a cutting cycle: Fat loss, Hard dry look and strength.",

    usage:
      "For the vast majority of users the dosage of Masteron will be kept at a low level. This is not a mass building steroid and increasing the dose in an attempt to gain muscle will be futile, with other compounds being much more suitable for that purpose. For physique enhancement Masteron has no need to be taken any higher than 400mg per week.",

      "Testosterone Enanthate is the most popular ester variant of the testosterone steroid. It has a half life of about 8 to 10 days and is a slow release testosterone steroid used in injectable form either for performance enhancement or as a TRT.",

    benefits:
      "Using Testosterone Enanthate you can expect excellent gains in muscle mass, improved recovery, reduction in body fat and the prevention of muscle breakdown.",

    usage:
      "Regardless of your experience level, Testosterone Enanthate is usually injected once (twice) per week to maintain the best blood levels of the hormone. Beginners will consider a weekly dosage of between 250mg and 500mg which will provide exceptional anabolic effects. Intermediate users can increase Testosterone Enanthate dosage up to 700mg weekly, with some advanced users increasing the dosage to 1000mg weekly as long as awareness of the much higher aromatizing side effects are taken into account.",
